## Project Overview

This project uses:

- **Ollama** ‚Äì Lightweight LLM (Large Language Model) runtime, operating locally.
- **Open WebUI** ‚Äì A browser-based interface to interact easily with your local AI.

By following this guide, you can install and interact with powerful language models entirely offline and securely.

## Installation Guide

### Requirements

- Linux OS (tested on Kali Linux)
- Python 3.11+ installed
- Docker installed
- Basic terminal knowledge

### Step 1: Install Ollama

This tool lets you run local AI models easily.

Visit the official [Ollama website](https://ollama.com) and download the Linux version.

Follow the installation instructions provided on the site.

Alternatively, install directly via terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

Once installed, open your browser and navigate to:

```arduino
http://localhost:11434
```

If you see the Ollama service running, the installation is successful.

---

### Step 2: Download a Language Model

Pick a model that suits your needs from the Ollama Models Library.

Example to install `openhermes`:

```bash
ollama pull openhermes
```

To list installed models:

```bash
ollama list
```

---

### Step 3: Clone Web-UI Repository

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui.git
cd web-ui
```

---

### Step 4: Set Up Python & Virtual Environment

You need Python 3.11+.

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
```

Activate it:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

Next, install Python packages:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, install **Patchright** for Chromium browser support:

```bash
patchright install chromium
```

---

### Step 6: Configure Environment

Create a copy of the example environment file: 

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Register your personal API keys and other settings.
Open `.env` in your preferred text editor, for example:

```bash
vim .env 
```

Enter your API in this file.

Please note: If you enter your OPENAI_API_KEY, usage will be billed directly to your OpenAI account based on the number of tokens consumed.


### Step 7: Run the Agent on Your Machine

Launch your AI agent locally with:

```bash
python webui.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 7788
```

Leave this running in your terminal.

Now open your browser and navigate to:

```arduino
http://localhost:7788
```

üéâ You‚Äôre in! Your personal AI agent is now ready to work for you.

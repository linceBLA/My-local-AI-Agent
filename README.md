## Installation Guide

### Requirements

- Linux OS (tested on Kali Linux)
- Python 3.11+ installed
- Docker installed
- Basic terminal knowledge

### Step 1: Install Ollama

This tool lets you run local AI models easily.

Visit the official [Ollama website](https://ollama.com) and download the Linux version.

Follow the installation instructions provided on the site.

Alternatively, install directly via terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

Once installed, open your browser and navigate to:

```arduino
http://localhost:11434
```

If you see the Ollama service running, the installation is successful.

### Step 2: Download a Language Model

Pick a model that suits your needs from the Ollama Models Library.

Example to install `openhermes`:

```bash
ollama pull openhermes
```

To list installed models:

```bash
ollama list
```

---

### Step 3: Clone Web-UI Repository

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui.git
cd web-ui
```

---

### Step 4: Set Up Python & Virtual Environment

You need Python 3.11+.

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

Activate it:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

---

### Step 5: Install the Local AI Agent

Next, install your own AI agent interface:

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

Additionally, install **Patchright** for Chromium browser support:

```bash
pip install patchright
patchright install chromium
```

---

### Step 6: Run the Agent on Your Machine

Launch your AI agent locally with:

```bash
python webui.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 7788
```

Leave this running in your terminal.

Now open your browser and navigate to:

```arduino
http://localhost:7788
```

üéâ You‚Äôre in! Your personal AI agent is now ready to work for you.
